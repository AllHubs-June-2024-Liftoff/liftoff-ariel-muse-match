# MuseMatch
MuseMatch is a web application that engages today’s users with human-made artworks through a simple, addictive UI that harkens to the Tinder “Swipe” system.
  * Why you’re building it: We want to engage users with human-made artwork in an age of AI generated art.
  * What it will do: It will strengthen the user’s familiarity and understanding of human-made artwork.
  * What problems it will solve: MuseMatch will provide a means for people to experience artwork they wouldn’t have otherwise by presenting it in a modern, convenient format.
  * Engagement with the application will ideally garner a respect and desire to see  more art in person, which may have a positive impact on museum attendance, which is still in recovery since the pandemic (Read more here)
